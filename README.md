# My First Remote Repo

This is my first remote repo.

It started life as a local git repository.

But you'll be able to read this on GitHub when we put it onto a GitHub remote!

Adding this text to indiciate a change has been made and I'm about to push this update to 
the github repository 

Ok so I've made a new branch off the main one
and now I'm writing stuff to update the file and create new changes in the document!
That should do the trick. 

here is another line of text to test out 
this line of text was added on through the terminal on the amazon workspace
I hope it work how do i get out of this.
This change was done on nano in the AWS terminal

A few more changes after cloning through SSH instead of HTTPS
